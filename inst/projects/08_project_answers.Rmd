# Getting to know QFeatures

We will be storing our proteomics data in a `QFeatures` object, which is similar to a `SummarizedExperiment` object. In addition to Chapter 8 of Omics Data Analysis, you can find relevant information in the following vignette - 

https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html

```{r}
# load a very simple data file
data(feat1)
feat1

# Notice the similarity between this object and the SummarizedExperiment objects you encountered during the RNA-seq analysis meetups - https://youtu.be/-nv_r7pvgWs

# Extract the sample metadata using the colData() accessor 
colData(feat1)

# Extract the first (and only) assay from this object
feat1[[1]]
# or
feat1[["psms"]]

# Extract assay data
assay(feat1)

# compare the output of `colData(feat1)` and `assay(feat1)`. How are they related?

# Extract the psms assayâ€™s row data and quantitative values
rowData(feat1[[1]]) # or rowData(feat1[["psms"]])

# To see the row data column names as a list
rowDataNames(feat1)
```

# Feature aggregation

```{r}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(object = feat1, 
                           i = "psms",
                           fcol = "Sequence",
                           name = "peptides",
                           fun = colSums)
?aggregateFeatures
feat1

# Take a look at data in "peptides" assay
assay(feat1[["peptides"]])

# confirm that these means were correctly calculated
# do just for sequence SYGFNAAR, which corresponds to the samples - PSM1, PSM2, and PSM3
assay(feat1[["psms"]]) %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "PSM") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(PSM %in% c("PSM1", "PSM2", "PSM3")) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mean(S1), mean(S2))

# Aggregate the peptide-level data into a new protein-level assay using the colMedians() aggregation function

feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(object = feat1, 
                           i = "peptides",
                           fcol = "Protein",
                           name = "proteins",
                           fun = colSums)
feat1

assay(feat1[["proteins"]])
```

# Subsetting and filtering

```{r}
# Only keep information related to ProtA
protA <- feat1["ProtA", , ]
protA

assay(protA[["psms"]])
assay(protA[["peptides"]])
assay(protA[["proteins"]])

# We can easily visualise this new QFeatures object using ggplot2 once converted into a data.frame
protA_df <- data.frame(longFormat(protA))
protA_df

protA_df$assay <- factor(protA_df$assay,
                        levels = c("psms", "peptides", "proteins"))

protA_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = colname,
    y = value,
    group = rowname, # tells ggplot HOW to connect the dots in the plot
    col = assay
  )) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ assay)

# Alternatively
feat1 %>% 
  subsetByFeature("ProtA") %>% 
  longFormat() %>%
    as.data.frame %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = colname,
               y = value,
               group = rowname,
               col = assay)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(~ assay)

# The filterFeatures() function can be used to filter rows using the row data variables. 
# For example, use this function only retain rows that have pval < 0.05
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ pval < 0.05)

# Notice that the resulting object only has a subset of the "psms" assay, and has dropped the other two assays
# This is because pval is only relevant to this assay

# On the other hand, if we filter assay rows for those that localise to the mitochondrion, we retain the relevant protein, peptides and PSMs
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location == "Mitochondrion")

# Filter rows that DO NOT localise to the mitochondrion
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location != "Mitochondrion")
```

# Create a QFeatures object

```{r}
data(hlpsms)
hlpsms

hl <- readQFeatures(table = hlpsms, 
                    ecol = 1:10, 
                    name = "psms")
?readQFeatures

hl

# Take a look at what's in this object
# Bonus: repeat what we did for feat1 using this object

```
