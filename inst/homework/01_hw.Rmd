```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load any necessary package(s)

Q1. Fix the errors in the code below 
```{r}
genes <- ("IGF1", "IGF1R", "AKT1", "SHC1", "IRS1")
exons <- (7, 26, 15, 14, 2)
```

Q2. Use the vectors created above to make a new data frame. Call this object `my_df`
```{r}
my_df <- 
```

Q3. Create a new data frame that only contains genes that have a higher-than-average exon number
```{r}
long_df <- 
```

Q4. Which function would you use to work out the number of rows and columns this new data frame contains?
```{r}

```

Q5. Create a new folder in your project called `data/`. Move a data file to this folder (the file can in any common format e.g. .csv, .xlsx etc). Import this file into your Global Environment and take a look at the first few rows 
```{r}

```
